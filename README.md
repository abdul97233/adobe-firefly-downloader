This can download images from adobe firefly without the watermark. Generate the images you want then open the console with CTRL + Shift + I then run [this](https://github.com/abdul97233/adobe-firefly-downloader/blob/main/universal-main.js) script.

> This script downloads the images and saves the **image data** to a file called "firefly-" and then the **current unix time**, the image index with a suffix of a "@", and the file extension will be a **.jpg**<br/><br/>
> The userscript adds a button at the bottom left of the page that runs the script while also telling you if you are doing it correctly or not and is like a seamless integration making it so you don't have to open developer tools and into console to run the script.
